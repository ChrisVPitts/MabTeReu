Note- all this is the goals for the first developmental beta build
Goal time of 1 year or so probably at the least, as there is a LOT here
All of this is subject to change

The main focus of development will be expandability. We would want all of our base systems to be easy to add to, making it easy to add new skills, items, characters, text, etc

-------------Items----------------
Inventory - Visual Grid

https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/designing-an-rpg-inventory-system-that-fits-preliminary-steps--gamedev-14725

Equip slots- to start
Hands - 2
Armor - 1(body)

Swords- 2
Axes- 2
Lances(perhaps battle rods/staffs??) - 2
Tools - 1 (pickaxe)
Shields - 1
Armors - 2
Ingots - 1 (iron)
Potions - 1/2(health, stamina?)

---------Skills------------
System- each skill starts at level 1 and ranks up on use, like mabinogi or rune factory(more like rune factory here at this point)
skills at certain levels unlock new quests for other skills or stuff

Sword, axe, lance masteries -
	Passive skills, increase your damage and stats with certain weapons, and unlock higher-level weapon skills and quests

Jump Mastery- Passive skill, adds jump distance, reduces landing delay and grants midair combat capabilities(using skills/attacks), unlocks quests to gain jump-based skills like multi-jump and air dodge
	Low priority- as little arial combat in the beggining

Multi-Jump- passive skill, but costs stamina on use, allows you jump multiple times in midair depending on rank,
starts at 2 jumps, ends at 3-4? perhaps
	low priority, as little arial combat in the beggining

Sword, axe, lance attack skills- active, costs stamina, can be bound to attack key
basic, cool animated attacking skills that fit into the combat system and each have their own advantages and disadvantages

Parry- active skill, assumes a defensive stance, first defensive type skill in the game and works better with a shield, if we get shields in the game, assumes a guard stance and drains your stamina for as long as you hold the button down

Smithing- crafting skill- usable only in town, allows new crafting recipies to be unlocked and reduces material cost/increases stats on crafted items

----------character development----------
Mostly skill-based, with each skill giving bonuses to stats like in rune factory or mabinogi
Stats-

HP- basic
Stamina- works as both mp and stamina, used for most skills and spells later on, and regenerates at a constant rate(1/s??)
Strength- determines damage with combat skills, increased through armor, skills, etc
Defense- determines damage enemies do to you, increased through skills, armor, shields, etc
Critical Chance- Weapon dependent, from 0 to 20ish probably
--Hidden--
Critical damage- doubled, make it easy and not change, hidden from player
Damage- str + weapon attack power
	Damage calculation = damage - defense with a variance of about 10% up or down to make it less guessable probably or something like that
--weapon--
Attack Range- weapon-type dependent
Attack speed- weapon-dependent

Development is mostly improving weapons/armor and finding and unlocking and training your character's skills which will be unlimited but require investment. So, you could use an axe and a sword and switch between, but that requires more inventory space(for weapons) and each will be weaker in levels than if you used one exclusively

----------Maps-----------
Home- interior with storage box, exterior with smith workshop - connects to town

Town- Exterior houses and one general shop to start - connects to home and field map

Field map- small, with weak monsters- connects to town and dungeon 1

dungeon 1- mines- with 4-5 rooms, a small puzzle??, and mining nodes to be hit with a pickaxe

----------Crafting---------
basic, go to workshop at home, select recipe with items you have, click build to craft item and raise smithing skill
later on can add minigame or stuff for making higher quality items

----------Assets needed----------
Models- each needs a texture too, naturally
	Player
	Enemy 1- small and easy, ex slime, wolf, etc
	Enemy 2- bigger, boss, ex ogre, giant spider, etc
	House- player home
	Furniture- a few smaller models probably
	Shop- Town shop- exterior
	Shopkeeper-based off player model probably, but with different clothes/features/etc
	Rocks- mining points
	Platforms-town, home, mine ground
	Backgrounds- town/field, home, mine
	Items- one for every inventory item, so about 13ish

Animations-
	Human- idle, walking, jumping, one for each/most skills + attacks(5-8ish)(3ish basic attacks, 1-3 offensive skills, and then 1-3 parry depending on how different the weapons need to look animation wise)
	Monster- 6ish basic attacks, 1-2 offensive, 1-2 defensive


----------Combat----------
Works very much like mabinogi's but with major changes
Each character will have 3 main methods of engaging an enemy, you can choose to use normal attacks for a small stamina cost, or use defensive or offensive skills
Basic attacks are fast and activate instantly, while defensive skills and offensive skills take time but are more varied
The challange is in choosing what to use when, as much like mabi there is a triangle

Basic attacks beat defensive skills
Defensive skills beat offensive skills
and offensive skills beat basic attacks

Using the correct skill results in canceling or blocking the enemies, and then stuns them for a small amount of time
in terms of ties, rather than random chance, first comes a weapon triangle, unless fire emblem wants to sue us we can change it around
Swords beat axes
Axes beat lances
lances beat swords

so sword(basic attack) > axe(basic attack) but sword(atkSkill) < axe(defSkill)

and defense skill vs defense skill is easy, it's just a staredown

an example of combat could be be a wolf that dodges(guard), bites(atkSkill) and scratches(basic attacks)
if you guard you can block their bites, which do more damage than basic attacks but are telegraphed, and the wolf will be stunned for a moment allowing you to attack

Each weapon/monster will have a 3-hit combo for basic attacks, after which the enemy or you will be knocked back
in the event of a complete tie(sword vs sword basic attacks for example) we could either roll a dice or just give it to the player to make the game a bit easier, depending on how the game is working out

defensive skills with either work(block you from getting stunned or taking massive damage) or fail(being broken through and the enemies attack works anyway

Offensive skills will either be blocked(dealing reduced/no stun or knockback) or break through(pushing an enemy back and dealing full damage)

We could have enemies that do different things, like mages that release powerful attacks that must be blocked or dodged, but have no defensive skills, or the wolf example could have no dodge or basic attacks making it easier to predict, and harder enemies can use more than one ability and use it in different ways

we could also include difficulty options that use this to our advantage, like easy mode reducing the stun you take and letting you play it more like a hackandslash, where hard mode increases your stun and damage you take to punish bad planning

The goal with this system would be to create rewarding, thoughtful combat, kind of like darksouls i guess where prediction and learning your character's strengths are needed to win.

---------Extra----------
In the end we would add more npcs, storyline, more dungeons and dungeons that are randomly generated, new enemies and bosses and just in general keep expanding thoughout development

We could add anything from base building to a castle defense minigame in the end, as long as we planned it out
