This is the first goal set for a very basic prototype of the combat system

For a full beta description see Beta goals

Our first alpha goals are ignoring most everything except combat
----------Description---------------
A small, 1 room rocky cave based dungeon(since the plan for the first dungeon in game is a mine) with a moving, attacking character and a fully immoble, punching bag enemy(that is also the character)

----------Needed Assets----------
-Character model + texture with sword
-Character walking, basic attacking, defending skill and attacking skill(4 animations)
-Rocky ground texture
-Rocky wall texture(for background)
-basic lighting(in unity)
------------Goal--------------
Animate a character that can walk, attack 3 times before knocking back the enemy, and activate defensive and offensive skills, where defensive assumes a defensive stance and offensive knocks the enemy back as if it was a full 3 hit combo
